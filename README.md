## Project Overview

### Problem Area

Whenever the health and medical field witnesses new advancements or innovations, it becomes imperative to conduct clinical trials to ascertain the safety and efficacy of the treatments. Often times, significant resources are dedicated towards the design, analysis, and conclusive determination of clinical trials. To optimize processes and minimize expenses, the goal is to pinpoint specific factors or parameters that contribute to clinical trial terminations. Some of these factors could include, not enough funding, shortage of personnel for the study, inadequate study design, ethical and scientific concerns, loss of staff members etc.

### Those Affected

Many large pharmaceutical companies, investors, and other research entities would benefit significantly by discerning the key parameters to prioritize in their clinical trial design. By creating a predictive model for clinical trial terminations, our aim is to guide these stakeholders towards more informed trial-design processes.

### Proposed Data Science Solution

1. Data Wrangling/Exploration: Exploring and understanding the dataset which includes data cleaning, feature selection, and preprocessing.
2. Data Analysis: Using statistics, distributions, and regression models to determine the key features that affect the termination of clinical trials.
3. Predictive Modeling: Using NLP and Word embedding to group keywords in the brief summary together for a more accurate model.

### Impact of the Solution

By creating this analysis and model, we can potentially save millions of dollars in funding by sponsors, investors, and the government. Additionally, by helping medical companies better understand the factors that cause clinical trial failures, we can improve the design of clinical trials and prevent loss of scientific advancements in medicine.
