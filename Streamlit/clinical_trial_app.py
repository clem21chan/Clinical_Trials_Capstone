# What are Clinical Trials?
st.markdown('## What are Clinical Trials?')
st.markdown('- Clinical Trials are research studies conducted on human participants to assess the **safety** and **effectiveness** of drugs. \
            \n - Newly developed drugs must be tested before they are released into public. \
            \n - Examples: Covid-19 Vaccines, Diabetic Medication, Hypertension, etc.')

# The Problem
st.markdown('## The Problem')
st.markdown('- Significant resources are dedicated towards the design, analysis, and conclusive determination of clinical trials. \
            \n - The average cost of clinical trials ranges from [1.4 million - 52.9 million USD](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1740774515625964) in 2015 \
            and is increasing at a rapid rate. \
            \n - [Previous studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26011295/) indicated that out of 8000 trials, 960 or **(12%)** will be terminated. \
            \n - Some factors include not enough funding, shortage of participants for the study, inadequate study design, ethical and scientific concerns, etc.')

             to create a predictive ML model that classifies terminated trials.')
