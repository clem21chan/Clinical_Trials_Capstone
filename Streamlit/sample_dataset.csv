0,Effectiveness of a Problem-solving Intervention for Common Adolescent Mental Health Problems in India,0,"We will conduct a two-arm individually randomized controlled trial in six Government-run secondary schools in New Delhi. The targeted sample is 240 adolescents in grades 9-12 with persistent, elevated mental health difficulties and associated impact. Participants will receive either a brief problem-solving intervention delivered by lay counsellors (intervention), or enhanced usual care comprised of problem-solving booklets (control). Self-reported adolescent mental health difficulties and idiographic problems will be assessed at 6 weeks (co-primary outcomes) and again at 12 weeks post-randomization. In addition, adolescent-reported impact of mental health difficulties, perceived stress, mental wellbeing and clinical remission, as well as parent-reported adolescent mental health difficulties and impact scores, will be assessed at 6 and 12 weeks post-randomization. Parallel process evaluation, including estimations of the costs of delivering the interventions, will be conducted.",0,"Mental Health Issue (E.G., Depression, Psychosis, Personality Disorder, Substance Abuse)",behavioral: pride 'step 1' problem-solving intervention|behavioral: enhanced usual care,"Mental health symptoms, The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a 25-item self-report measure of youth mental health symptoms (Goodman et al., 2000). A Total Difficulties score is derived by summing items from four problem subscales (Emotional, Conduct, Hyperactivity/inattention and Peer problems). The measure is the most widely used clinical and research instrument in the field of child and adolescent mental health globally. The Hindi version will be used in complementary forms for self-report by adolescents and parents. The adolescent-reported SDQ Total Difficulties score (at 6-week end-point) will be a co-primary outcome, while the corresponding caregiver-reported SDQ Total Difficulties score will be an exploratory outcome., 6 weeks|Idiographic problems, The Youth Top Problems (YTP) is a brief, idiographic measure which identifies, prioritizes and scores respondents' three main problems (Weisz et al., 2011). Each nominated problem is scored from 0 ('not a problem') to 10 ('huge problem'). A mean severity score is calculated by summing individual problem scores and then dividing by the number of nominated problems. The YTP will be used to assess problems that other scales might address generally or otherwise miss; while providing a sensitive measure of specific priorities of the participant within a larger array of problems., 6 weeks","Mental health symptoms, The adolescent-reported SDQ Total Difficulties score at 12 weeks will be a secondary outcome, while the corresponding caregiver-reported SDQ Total Difficulties score will be an exploratory outcome., 12 weeks post-randomization|Idiographic problems, The adolescent-reported YTP severity score at 12 weeks will be a secondary outcome., 12 weeks post-randomization|Impact of mental health problems, The SDQ Impact Supplement measures distress and functional impairment associated with index mental health problems identified on the main SDQ scale. The adolescent-reported SDQ Impact Supplement score will be a secondary outcome, while the corresponding caregiver-reported SDQ Impact Supplement score will be an exploratory outcome., 12 weeks post-randomization|Internalising symptoms, Adolescent-reported internalising symptoms will be assessed as a secondary outcome using the combined peer and emotional problem sub-scales of the SDQ. The corresponding caregiver-reported SDQ Internalising score will be an exploratory outcome., 12 weeks post-randomization|Externalising symptoms, Adolescent-reported externalising symptoms will be assessed as a secondary outcome using the combined conduct and hyperactivity problem sub-scales of the SDQ. The corresponding caregiver-reported SDQ Externalising score will be an exploratory outcome., 12 weeks post-randomization|Prosocial behaviour, Adolescent-reported prosocial behaviour will be assessed as an exploratory outcome using the prosocial sub-scale of the SDQ., 12 weeks post-randomization|Perceived stress, The adolescent-reported Perceived Stress Scale-4-item version (PSS-4) will be used as a secondary outcome measure to assess the perception of stress, reflecting the degree to which situations are appraised as stressful during the preceding month (Cohen et al., 1983). This measure was chosen because of its relevance as a presumed mechanism of change within the problem-solving intervention, consistent with stress-coping theory (Lazarus \& Folkman, 1984). It has been translated into Hindi and used in a number of surveys and as an outcome measure in trials around the world (Lee, 2012)., 12 weeks post-randomization|Mental wellbeing, The adolescent-reported Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS) will be used as a secondary measure to assess mental wellbeing (Stewart-Brown et al., 2009), which has been closely linked with social factors such as peer bullying and perception of school connectedness (Patalay \& Fitzsimons; 2016). It may therefore be especially amenable to problem-solving around common life difficulties encountered by school-going adolescents. The SWEMWBS is widely used internationally (Stewart-Brown, 2013) and a Hindi version is available., 12 weeks post-randomization|Clinical remission, This secondary outcome will be defined as falling below baseline eligibility cut-offs on both the SDQ Total Difficulties scale and Impact Supplement (i.e. SDQ Total Difficulties score in normal range and Impact score in the normal or borderline range)., 12 weeks post-randomization",Sangath,Harvard Medical School (HMS and HSDM)|London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT",NO PHASE,210-490,OTHER,1,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","Sangath, New Delhi, Delhi, 110016, India",123-244

12,Comparison of Serum C Type Natriuretic Peptide Levels Between Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Patients and Healthy Women,0,"Recent studies have shown that C natriuretic peptide is produced from granulosa cells, increasing cumulative guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production by affecting cumulus cells through natriuretic peptide receptors. It is suggested that produced cGMP maintains the transport of oocytes via the gap junctions and leads to a continuous increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in the oocyte. An important role of increased internal cAMP levels in the oocyte is shown to suppress meiotic progression.

Deoxyribonucleic acid studies in animals have shown that expression of the natriuretic peptide precursor increases during the periovulatory period and shows that this increase decreases rapidly after luteinizing hormone / human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation.Human studies have shown that after ovulation induction, the CNP level in follicular fluid decreases following ovulatory dose of hCG.Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disease in the reproductive period, characterized by hyperandrogenism, oligo-anovulation, and polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasonography, and in an animal study investigating the relationship between CNP and PCOS, serum CNP levels were increased in polycystic ovary syndrome.CNP serum level is thought to show differences between healthy women and women with polycystic ovary syndrome.",1,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome|c Type Natriuretic Peptide|Menstrual Irregularity|Hyperandrogenism,diagnostic_test: c type natriuretic peptide,"Serum CNP Levels of PCOS and Healthy Participants, The comparison of serum levels of C type natriuretic peptide among PCOS and healthy women, Second or Third Day of Menstruation|Roc Curve of CNP, We made a cut off value estimation for the diagnosis of PCOS by serum CNP levels using Receiver operator characteristics.

Most Hong Kong people are having sedentary lifestyle. Researchers show that the increase of physical activity reduces the risk of chronic diseases, and improve cardio-pulmonary functions; whereas sedentary behaviors increase the risks.

For many people, the targets of the WHO physical activity guidelines are too high to be achieved. Some people are not even willing to try, despite the evidence for the protective benefits to their long term health. In response, a recent focus has been placed upon reduction of sedentary behavior. Sedentary behavior is defined as 'those activities that do not increase energy expenditure substantially above the resting level, such as sitting, lying down, or viewing TV, or simply as ""too much sitting"". The primary determinants of sedentary behavior are behavioral and context-based, such as TV and screen-focused behaviors in home and work environments, sitting at work, and sitting during transport.

43,Predicting Medication Response in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,0,"In this study, the investigators hope to study a number of variables the investigators believe may help us predict why some people respond better to some medications than others. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of two typical medications for OCD, clomipramine or escitalopram. Individuals who would like to participate but who have previously tried one or both of these medications may instead take a newer drug, duloxetine, and undergo the identical procedures. The factors the investigators will be studying include demographics (i.e. age, gender, age of onset of OCD), genetic markers (such as variants in genes involved in breaking down drugs in the liver (cytochrome P450 system), and genes involved in several brain chemical systems, such as serotonin), the dimensions of OCD symptoms (i.e. checking, washing, and hoarding) and cortical inhibition. Cortical inhibition will be measured transcranial magnetic stimulation and is being studied because deficits in this process may be important in the development of OCD. The investigators hypothesize that certain pretreatment clinical characteristics will correlate with poor treatment response including earlier age of onset, longer duration of illness, increased YBOCS severity and presence of significant hoarding symptoms. The investigators expect that increasing degree of deficit in CI pre-treatment will predict poor treatment response, but that increase in CI from pre- to post-treatment will correlate with a positive treatment response.

46,Solving Wellness: An Initiative to Enhance Canadian Healthcare Provider Wellness,0,"Given the high incidence of burnout, depression, and suicidal ideation among Canadian healthcare providers (HCPs), there is an urgent need to support wellness through strengthening peer networks and engaging key stakeholders. This project will explore the capacity of digital tools to educate HCPs and enable them to support their mental health. The investigators will evaluate specific research questions: Are HCPs more aware of their wellness needs? Did burnout and stress decrease? Do HCPs feel more supported by their peers? The overarching objective is to contribute towards a culture prioritizing HCP wellbeing. The investigators hope to achieve this through two outcome-oriented objectives: 1) to create resources to promote HCP wellbeing and 2) to foster a web-based HCP community. This initiative integrates big data tools, interactive online content, and the Solving Healthcare podcast to improve HCP wellness. It is anticipated that HCPs will become more aware of their wellness needs, and once they are able to identify strategies to live healthier work lives, cultural changes will take place, leading to a new attitude surrounding HCP mental health. To complete these objectives, resources will be drawn from the HELP-MD physician database and an advisory circle, and will be disseminated via a web platform and the widely known Solving Healthcare podcast.

* Most studies of infectious agents have focused on specific microbes, such as human papillomaviruses and cervical cancer, and the hepatitis B and C virus and liver cancer. The skin and many internal areas (including the mouth and the gastrointestinal tract) also contain large numbers of naturally occurring microbes, but these areas have not received as much study.
* Some of the infectious agents that naturally reside in the body may have an effect on health. The study of naturally occurring microbes in the human body is a new area of research, and much remains to be learned regarding the extent and pattern of their appearance and appropriate techniques for testing them.
* Researchers are interested in collecting human samples from areas known to contain naturally occurring microbes. These samples will provide baseline information for further studies.

A 2010 study showed that in Canada and the incidence of injections grew 8 fold from 2005 to 2007 to 25.9 injections per 100,000 citizens. (Campbell 2010) In 2009, in the United States, over 1 million intravitreal injections were administered to Medicare beneficiaries. (Wykoff 2011) In the year 2011, the four doctors in my retina group administered a total of 6,494 intravitreal injections; in 2010, we administered 5021 intravitreal injections.

Even though intravitreal injections are commonly administered, the optimal method of anesthetizing the eye prior to injection has yet to be determined. Some physicians use an anesthetic drop, some a soaked cotton pledget, some use an anesthetic gel and some use subconjunctival injected anesthetic.

In 2009, the last time the Procedures and Trends Survey (PAT) (Mittra 2009) conducted by the American Society of Retina Specialists (the largest retina society in the world) asked about anesthetic methods for administering intravitreal injections, the following response was given by the 433 respondents:

* Topical anesthetic drop: 21.48%
* Topical viscous anesthetic: 23.33%
* Topical anesthetic \& soaked cotton-tip or pledget: 29.79%
* Subconjunctival injection of anesthetic: 24.02%

59,Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis in the Emergency Department,0,"Despite an increasing armamentarium of behavioral and biomedical HIV prevention methods, since 2010 rates of new infection have remained around 40,000 annually. The demonstrated efficacy and subsequent approval of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV by the FDA in 2012 was thought to represent a turning point that could significantly reduce the number of new infections. Since approval, the promise of PrEP as a transformative intervention has yet to be realized. Despite the implementation of systems for clinical evaluation for and initiation of PrEP by primary care providers, HIV specialists, and STI clinics, numerous barriers to PrEP expansion have been identified, including: 1) patient and provider lack of knowledge, 2) lack of access to medical care among high-risk individuals, 3) provider discomfort and inexperience with screening for risk behaviors, and 4) insurance and affordability.

105,Brown Adipose Tissue Activity and Thyroid Hormone,0,"Rationale: During the last decades, research in possible therapies for existing obesity and developmental factors causing obesity has explosively increased. Recently renewed interest aroused for a tissue playing a possible role in both development and therapy for obesity: brown adipose tissue (BAT).

To define the relation between BAT and thyroid hormone, the investigators set up the following research protocol. In this protocol BAT activity will be determined in subjects that underwent thyroidectomy for well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma.

Objective: To study the effect of thyroid hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone on brown adipose tissue activity.

Study design: Determine BAT activity after thyroidectomy in well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma patients.

Study population: Patients that underwent thyroidectomy for well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma, male and female, aged 18-65 years.

Intervention: FDG-PET-CT-imaging (\[18F\]fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission-tomography computed-tomography) of BAT activity will be performed under cold stimulation twice.

For patients clinically withdrawn from thyroid hormone suppletion, the first occasion will be in a hypothyroid state within 4-6 weeks after thyroidectomy and the second measurement will take place in a euthyroid state 4 months after the start of thyroid hormone treatment.

For patients receiving recombinant-thyroid-stimulating-hormone injections, the first occasion will be shortly after the injection in a state of high thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. The second measurement will be in a euthyroid state 4 months after the injection.

Main study parameters/endpoints: The main endpoint of this study is the effect of thyroid hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone on BAT activity in kBq (kilobecquerel) and SUV (standard uptake value). Secondary endpoints are the effects of thyroid hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone on energy metabolism, body core temperature, skin surface temperatures and skin perfusion.

The Charlson Comorbidity Index is a method of categorizing comorbidities of patients based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis. Each comorbidity category has an associated weight (from 1 to 6), based on the adjusted risk of mortality or resource use, and the sum of all the weights results in a single comorbidity score for a patient. A score of zero indicates that no comorbidities were found. The higher the score, the more likely the predicted outcome will result in mortality or higher resource use. Up to 12 comorbidities with various weightings can result in a maximum score of 24.

118,Effects of Acupuncture on the Radial Pressure Pulse-wave at Cunkou in Low Back Pain,0,"Introduction: In TCM, Pulse Diagnosis has been one of the key diagnostic components in the clinical examinations. Traditionally, the palpation of the pulse on the radial artery is subjective among the physicians. With the development of the various devices to study the radial pressure pulse wave (RPPW), these have provided a scientific and objective assessment to assist the physicians on diagnosis and treatment. The primary objective of this intervention study is to investigate the effects of Acupuncture on the RPPW at cunkou in Low Back Pain (LBP) through the pulse sphygmograph. The secondary objective is to investigate the effect of acupoint combinations on different type LBP based on TCM syndrome differentiation through the primary and secondary outcome evaluations.

Methods: A single group, pre-post intervention study in which all participants receiving the same intervention will be conducted. A total 80 participants that meet all the following criteria will be enrolled: a. at least 20 years of age of either gender; b. chief complaint being low back pain; c. diagnosis with Lumbago (ICD-9-CM 724.2) or low back pain: loin pain, low back strain and lumbago NOS (not otherwise specified) (ICD-10-CM M54.4); d. diagnosis with lumbago with sciatica (ICD-10-CM M54.5). All participants will undergo acupuncture at BI23, BI25 \& Bl40 after obtaining written informed consent. Objective and subjective baseline assessments and outcome evaluations including Vital Signs, health status questionnaire, Constitution in Chinese Medicines Questionnaire (CCMQ), Oswestry Disability Index, Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) will be performed. The primary outcome will be the assessment of RPPW at cunkou ie at Cun, Guan \& Chi of both hands using Pulse Sphygmograph before and after the intervention. The secondary outcome involves evaluating low back pain using the Fingertips-to-floor test \& FPS-R before and after the intervention.

Expected Outcome: The results will be analyzed and provide information which can serve as clinical evidence of the influence of acupuncture on the RPPW at cunkou.

133,Function-oriented Assistive Technology Indexing System Development and Promotion,0,"Appropriate assistive devices are important factors for the activity participation of the disabled. These devices should be prescribed by the specialists based on their functional needs. However, most individuals in need of assistive devices locate in the household, school, or nursing institute, in which the professional interventions are not always available on demand. Consequently most assistive devices are used without thorough evaluation, therefore do not necessarily meet the exact needs of the individual. Hence an easy-to-access and easy-to-use assistive technology device indexing system based on the functional needs of the subjects is necessary. The goals of this two-year study are twofold: assistive technology indexing system application(APP) development and promotion. First, the multidisciplinary research team, composed of specialists from assistive technology, rehabilitation, computer science, and special education fields, is going to integrate and refine the current resources and develop an assistive technology indexing system App based on the functional needs of the disabled. Second, in cooperation with the disabled community and special schools, the team is going to promote the use of the App and evaluate its usability via System Usability Scale. This App will be beneficial to the individuals in need of assistive device application. It can also be used as an assistive device manual for the specialists. The App will guide the individuals step by step to the proper assistive devices based on their functional capacities. The complete system will include details of each assistive device and link up with the related service resources.

151,Effects of Rosiglitazone on Blood Vessels in Patients With High Blood Pressure and High Cholesterol,0,"Cells in the lining of blood vessels produce various substances that cause the vessels to dilate (relax) and constrict (tighten), thereby regulating blood flow. In patients with high blood pressure and high cholesterol, the blood vessels do not dilate properly. This study will investigate the effects of rosiglitazone-a drug used to improve the action of insulin in diabetic patients-on blood flow by examining its effects on endothelin (a substance that causes vessel constriction), and other substances produced by the vessel-lining cells.

Adults with blood pressure recordings of 140/90 mmHg or higher on at least three separate days or with a blood cholesterol level of at least 240 mg/dl may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood pressure recordings, blood and urine tests.

This ""crossover"" study involves two separate treatment periods; that is, participants will take either rosiglitazone or placebo (an inactive look-alike pill) once a day for 8 weeks, then no drug for 4 weeks, and then the alternative treatment for the next 8 weeks. Patients will continue to take their high blood pressure medicines during the first 6 weeks of each treatment period. They will stop the medication 2 weeks before the following procedures, which are done at the end of each 8-week treatment period:

Strain gauge plethysmography-A small catheter is placed through a needle into an artery at the bend of the arm for measuring blood pressure and drawing blood samples during the study. Pressure cuffs are placed on the wrist and upper arm, and a strain gauge (a rubber band device) is placed around the forearm to measure forearm blood flow. When the cuffs are inflated, blood flows into the arm, stretching the strain gauge at a rate proportional to the flow, and the measurement is recorded.

Small doses of four drugs-acetylcholine, bradykinin, sodium nitroprusside and BQ-123-are given through the catheter. Acetylcholine slows the heart rate. Bradykinin stimulates the release of a substance that causes blood vessels to dilate and can lower blood pressure. Sodium nitroprusside causes blood vessels to dilate and is used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. BQ-123 blocks the blood vessel-constricting activity of endothelin.

Brachial ultrasound reactivity study-A baseline ultrasound image (picture produced using sound waves) of the brachial artery (artery located at the bend of the arm) is taken and blood flow measurements are recorded. Then, a pressure cuff is placed around the upper forearm, inflated for 5 minutes to stop blood flow to the forearm, and then released. Images of the artery and flow measurements are repeated.

152,Attention Bias Modification Training for Young People,0,"Attention bias modification training (ABMT) is a computer-based attention training programme designed to modify the way a person's attention is directed to mild threats in the environment. What a person focuses their attention on plays an important role in how safe or unsafe they feel in certain situations. Much research has shown that people with high levels of anxiety tend to focus their attention on negative information in their surroundings. The purpose of ABMT is to set in place attention patterns that do not lead to excessive anxiety. The present study will test whether this treatment is effective in reducing social anxiety in 15-18 year olds in school settings.

The study design consists of two phases. During Phase 1 participants will complete a screening questionnaire in relation to their wellbeing and emotions. This questionnaire will include a measure of the affective, cognitive, and behavioural components of social anxiety in adolescence. Depending on their suitability (i.e. scoring above a cut-off on a standardised measure of social anxiety in Phase 1 of the study), participants may then be invited to take part in a 4-week computer-based attention training programme. The purpose of this phase is to see if ABMT will help young people feel less worried or nervous in social situations by teaching them to focus on their environment differently.

Previous research containing attention training tasks similar to this training programme suggests that attention training can reduce symptoms of social anxiety in adolescents. Individuals who are invited to take part in the training session will be randomly assigned to either the intervention (ABMT) or placebo (inactive) group. Both groups will be asked to complete a 4-week programme involving one computer training session per week (each session takes approximately 15-20 minutes).

Questionnaires will also be given to participants to complete before and after the intervention, along with a 12-week follow up assessment. These will include questionnaires to measure social anxiety, depressive symptoms, and fears in relation to negative evaluation. Each questionnaire will take approximately 40 minutes to complete. Participants will not know whether they have received the intervention or placebo training until after the intervention.",1,Anxiety|Depression,behavioral: abmt|other: placebo,"Threat Bias Measurement at 4-week Post-intervention and 12-week Follow-up, The bias measurement protocol consists of 120 trials (80 angry-neutral and 40 neutral-neutral presentations).

The participant must perform with more than 70% accuracy on the first 10 trials.The threat bias measurement consisted of 120 trials of the dot-probe task, 80 of which contained angry-neutral face pairs and 40 of which contained neutral-neutral face pairs. The threat bias score equal the mean of neutral NT trials minus mean of threat NT trials. A threat bias scores \>0 indicate a bias towards threat, whereas scores \<0 mean that the participant is slower to respond to threatening stimuli than neutral stimuli.

154,Evaluation of Safety and Tolerability of Nitric Oxide Impregnated Urinary Catheters,0,"According to the World Health Organization, hundreds of millions of patients are affected by health-care associated infections worldwide each year, resulting in prolonged hospital stays, long-term disabilities, deaths, and financial losses for health systems. The most common hospital-acquired infection is Urinary Tract Infection (UTI), accounting for almost 40% of all nosocomial infections. Most hospital-acquired UTIs are associated with catheterization. In fact, urinary catheter-related bacteriuria is the most common health care associated infection worldwide. Catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI) develops following adhesion of planktonic bacteria to the surface of the catheter and colonization, creating a persistent environment called a biofilm. The nature of biofilm structure together with the physiological attributes of biofilm organisms confers an inherent resistance to various antimicrobial agents such as antibiotics, disinfectants or germicides, augmenting the potential of these pathogens to cause infections in catheterized patients.

Nitric oxide (NO) is a naturally-produced gas molecule with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. NO is used in the clinics to treat pulmonary hypertension in neonates and adults. Studies have shown that low-dose NO is associated with prevention of biofilm formation, biofilm dispersal and elimination of bacteria. It is suggested that NO prevents bacteria attachment to catheter surfaces and inhibits biofilm formation in a mechanism involving reduction and modification of proteins that mediate cell-substrate and cell-cell interactions.

The investigators team, using a proprietary technology impregnate urinary catheters with NO (i.e. NO-impregnated catheters). These catheters release low concentration of NO following exposure to urine over a 14-day period. In vitro studies showed that NO-impregnated catheters prevent bacterial colonization and biofilm formation of Escherichia coli on exterior and luminal surfaces of the catheters. In addition, NO released from these catheters is able to eradicate up to 4log colony forming unit/ml of bacteria within the surrounding media. Moreover, NO-impregnated catheters exhibit superior performance compared to silver-coated catheters, and similar anti-infective properties compared to antibiotic-coated catheters.

The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of BEZ235 on Objective Response Rate (best response on study) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria

The secondary objectives are:

* To determine the progression free survival rate at 32 weeks in the included population
* To assess the duration of response among responders
* To evaluate time to response
* To evaluate the time to progression
* To assess the overall survival
* To evaluate safety and tolerability of BEZ235

The exploratory objectives are:

* To identify molecular and genomic profiles of PEComas and their potential relationship to clinical outcome by analyzing PIK3CA, Ras, Raf, TSC, AKT and PTEN alteration in tumor samples (archival or fresh pre-treatment tumor biopsy) and PIK3CA in circulating DNA.
* To determine biomarkers relevant to BEZ235 activity by analyzing the expression of phosphoproteins p-AKT, p-S6, p-4EBP1 at screening and during treatment as well as biomarkers for the proliferation (Ki-67) and apoptosis (PARP) (only if fresh tissue (optional) is available).

Study population:

The patient population consists of patients 18 years old or older with progressive unresectable/advanced or metastatic malignant PEComas previously treated for unresectable/advanced/metastatic disease with 1 to 2 prior lines of chemotherapy. Patients must have adequate hematologic, renal, cardiac and hepatic functions and not be previously treated with a mTOR inhibitor.

169,Presential Vs Online Group-based Psychosocial Treatment for Breast Cancer Survivors.,0,"This multicenter study is a sequential RCT which aims to prove, in the first stage, the efficacy of a face-to-face Positive Psychotherapy in Cancer (PPC) group compared to a Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM) group. In the second stage, the common face-to-face version of the PPC will be compared with its online version via videoconference (Online group Positive Psychotherapy, OPPC) among a group of primary breast cancer survivors. The principal dependent variables assessed will be emotional distress, post-traumatic growth (PTG) and quality of life (QoL). Some treatment predictors of psychosocial response will be explored. Lastly, an economic analysis focused on the Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) will be carried out at each stage. For the first stage, we hypothesize that the PCC group would achieve similar efficacy in reducing participants' distress compared to the CBSM group, while the PCC group would show greater improvement in PTG than the CBSM group. For the second stage, it is hypothesized that the OPCC would achieve similar efficacy in all psychosocial variables and guarantee equivalent retention and adherence compared to face-to-face PPC.",0,Breastcancer|Emotional Disorder|Distress,behavioral: positive psychotherapy|behavioral: positive online psychotherapy|behavioral: cognitive behavioral therapy,"Change in Posttraumatic Symptoms (patients), PCL-C (Posttraumatic Checklist -Civilian Version; Weathers et al., 1991), validated in Spanish for cancer patients (Costa-Requena and Gil, 2010).

170,Treatment for Adolescent Marijuana Abuse,0,"Marijuana remains the most prevalent illicit substance used by adolescents and the number of adolescents receiving treatment for marijuana abuse more than tripled during the last decade. A small number of clinical trials suggest that family-based and individual interventions have efficacy for treating adolescent substance abuse. However, even with these interventions most adolescents fail to reduce their substance use substantially, thus, there remains much room for improvement of treatment services. The overarching goal of this project is to develop and test novel behavioral treatments to enhance treatment outcome in this important treatment population, and in so doing, learn more about mechanisms of change that have broader implications for addiction science. In our initial Stage IB project ""Behavioral Treatment for Adolescent Marijuana Abuse"", we created, manualized, and pilot tested a unique contingency-management (CM) intervention that combined abstinence-based voucher incentives with contingency management training for parents. A small randomized, clinical trial provided encouraging results. When added to a commonly used cognitive-behavior therapy, CM improved rates of sustained abstinence during treatment. Adolescents receiving this intervention were less likely to relapse over the 9-month follow-up period, however this finding was not as robust as the observed during treatment effects, most likely due to the small sample size and associated low power to detect effects. Despite strong indicators of the efficacy of this CM intervention, there remained room for improvement in increasing rates of treatment response and reducing rates of relapse. Hypothesized mediators and moderators of change indicated that changes in parenting had direct effects on post-treatment marijuana abstinence outcomes, and that abstinence early in treatment was a robust predictor of the CM treatment effect. This proposal will systematically replicate and extend these findings. A Stage II trial will compare three treatment conditions: (1) cognitive behavior therapy (CBT only); (2) CBT plus CM; and (3) CBT plus an enhanced CM model targeting increased early abstinence rates, parenting skills, and maintenance of effects. Replicating the initial demonstration of the positive effects of CM will extend the scientific evidence for use of CM to increase treatment efficacy for substance-abusing adolescents. Testing an enhanced CM model will determine if modifications that are consistent with the underlying behavioral principles and empiricism supporting CM interventions can result in improved outcomes. Last, assessment of potential mechanisms of action, particularly parenting, adolescent psychopathology and impulsivity, will provide scientific information directly relevant to future development of more effective intervention and prevention models of adolescent substance abuse, and will inform us about fundamental mechanisms operating in drug-dependence.",1,Marijuana Abuse,behavioral: met/cbt|behavioral: cm|behavioral: bpt,"Marijuana Abstinence (2 Weeks or Greater), Percentage of participants who achieved 2 continuous weeks of marijuana abstinence as verified by twice weekly urine testing during the 14 weeks of treatment., Testing done twice weekly for 14 weeks.|Marijuana Abstinence (4 Weeks or Greater), Percentage of participants who achieved 4 continuous weeks of marijuana abstinence as verified by twice weekly urine testing during the 14 weeks of treatment., Twice weekly urine tests for 14 weeks.","Proportion of Days of Marijuana Abstinence Across All Days of Treatment (14 Weeks), This reflects the mean proportion of days of marijuana abstinence for each participant, This is for the proportion of days abstinent across the entire 14-week treatment period.

182,"The Effect of a Large-volume Paracentesis on Fatigue, Sleep, and Quality of Life in Cirrhosis",1,"Ascites is the accumulation of fluid within the peritoneal cavity of the abdomen. It is a frequent complication of cirrhosis that is associated with significant morbidity and poor quality of life. Large-volume ascites has been associated with impaired pulmonary function. In a previous study, the presence and severity of ascites were determined to be significant determinants of fatigue.

In this study, we will determine whether large-volume ascites contributes to fatigue by assessing the response to drainage of ascites by means of a procedure called large-volume paracentesis. We hypothesize that treatment of ascites with a single large-volume paracentesis leads to decreased fatigue and improved quality of life and that this improvement is associated with improved sleep pattern.

20 patients with cirrhosis with refractory ascites requiring regular drainage of ascites fluid by large-volume paracenteses will be recruited for the study. All patients will undergo a complete clinical and physical examination for liver function, including blood tests. Hepatic encephalopathy, a change in mental status associated with liver dysfunction, will be assessed by obtaining historical data and by means of simple bedside neuropsychological examinations.

Study visits will take place on two consecutive days, with each visit lasting approximately 2-3 hours.

192,Blue Light Imaging (BLI) for Optical Diagnosis of Colorectal Polyps,0,"Several imaging technologies have been developed in order to enable the endoscopists to differentiate neoplastic from non-neoplastic lesions. The real-time prediction of polyps histology is clinically relevant as diminutive polyps represent the majority of polyps detected during colonoscopy and have a very low risk of harboring advanced histology or invasive carcinoma. Thus, an optical diagnosis would allow diminutive polyps to be resected and discarded without pathological assessment or left in place without resection, with an enormous cost-saving potential. Recently, the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) has set the Preservation and Incorporation of Valuable endoscopic Innovation (PIVI) which defined accuracy threshold to be met, in order to consider a new technology ready to be incorporate into clinical practice. Blue Light Imaging (BLI) is a new chromoendoscopy technology integrated in the latest generation ELUXEOTM 7000 endoscopy platform (Fujifilm Co, Tokyo, Japan), based on the direct (i.e. not filtered) emission of blue light with short wavelength (410nm), that enhances visibility of both microvascular and superficial mucosal pattern. In a recent randomized trial BLI was superior to high-definition white light (HDWL) in the real time characterization of subcentimetric and diminutive colonic polyps. Nevertheless, in this study the paucity of diminutive rectosigmoid polyps analyzed does not allow to draw definite conclusions as the meeting of PIVI thresholds are concerned. Similarly, the low numbers of patients evaluated limited the per-patient analysis. Therefore further studies adequately powered to this clinically end-point were advocated. Additionally, when the study was performed a BLI dedicated classification for optical diagnosis of colonic polyps was not available, whereas recently a specific classification (the BLI Adenoma Serrated International Classification-BASIC) has been developed and a specific training set has been settled.

In the present study the investigators prospectively evaluate whether the use of BLI-assisted optical characterization of diminutive polyps using BASIC classification by specifically trained endoscopists may met PIVI thresholds and particularly if it allow the endoscopists to achieve \> 90% correct assignment of post-polypectomy surveillance intervals when combined with the histopathology assessment of polyps \>5 mm in size.",0,Colonic Polyp,diagnostic_test: colonic polyp characterization by bli,"Accuracy of post-polypectomy surveillance interval, Surveillance interval will be advised for each patient, basing on high-confidence predictions of \<5mm polyp histology. Such information will be merged with the histopathology assessment of both polyps \>5 mm in size and \<5 mm lesions diagnosed with a low confidence.

Significance of Study: Cancer related fatigue is a common side effect of cancer. Cancer related fatigue is poorly understood. Many different biological mechanisms have been theorized, including mitochondrial dysfunction. Self-reported descriptions of reduced energy and muscle weakness lend support for a possible relationship of cancer related fatigue to mitochondrial dysfunction.

The aim of this study is to evaluate whether lung ultrasound, in addition to physical examination, leads to a reduction of the admission rate for acute decompensated heart failure of patients with chronic heart failure (HF) followed in the outpatients heart failure clinic.

Methods. This is a prospective randomized study. The planned sample size consists of 440 patients with chronic HF.

The inclusion criteria are: (1) male and female aged between 18 and 90 years (2) signed written informed consent (3) history of HF for at least six months, (4) left ventricular ejection fraction \< 45%, (5) adequate medical therapy for HF for at least two months.

The exclusion criteria are: (1) concomitant enrollment in other clinical studies, or treatment with experimental drugs or devices within 30 days of clinical assessment, (2) inability to undergo to the planned follow-up and procedures (3) documented pulmonary infections (3) interstitial lung disease and class 4 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease according to GOLD classification.

Patients are randomized in two groups: group A, patients undergoing to lung ultrasound and physical examination; and group B, patients undergoing to physical examination only. Patients are evaluated at baseline and after three months with medical history, Quality of Life test, physical examination, blood sample for hematochemical (creatinine, electrolytes, BNP/NTpro-BNP).

The diuretic therapy is then optimized according to the presence and severity of B-lines in group A and physical examination in group B.

Only patients enrolled in group A undergo to a lung ultrasound examination to assess the extent of pulmonary congestion, through its evidence of B-lines. B-lines originate from the contrast between air-filled structures and water-thickened pulmonary interlobular septa. This leads to linear echogenic vertical artefacts that spread from the pleural layers downwards in the screen. The ultrasound examination is performed with a handheld echocardiography device. The physician carries out a scan of the pulmonary fields, from basal towards mid and apical fields, through the midaxillary line while the patient lies supine. The quantification of B-lines is performed according to their extent over the lung fields. All the information are recorded in dedicated forms.

The results are evaluated according to the following criteria. The primary end-point is a significant reduction of hospitalizations for acute decompensated HF in group A during the follow-up period. The secondary end-points are changes of NT-proBNP values, quality of life test (QLT) score and cardiac mortality.",0,Chronic Heart Failure|Lung; Congestive|Acute Decompensated Heart Failure,diagnostic_test: lung ultrasound,"Reduction of hospitalizations for acute decompensated heart failure, Significant reduction of hospitalizations for acute decompensated heart failure in group A during the 90-day follow-up period., 90 days","Natriuretic peptides values, Significant reduction of natriuretic peptides values in group A during the 90-day follow-up period., 90 days|Quality of life test (QLT) score, Significant reduction of QTL score in group A during the 90-day follow-up period., 90 days|Cardiac mortality, Significant reduction of cardiac mortality rate in group A versus group B., 90 days",IRCCS San Raffaele,none,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,210-490,OTHER,1,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,"San Raffaele Hospital, Milano, 20132, Italy",1461-2049

242,Hybridized Three Steps Intervention to Prevent Diabetes in Venezuela,0,"The American Diabetes Association recommends implementing the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) in subjects with prediabetes. In the DPP, weight reduction was the main predictor of a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), each kilogram lost was related with 16% lower incidence. However, the effectiveness of the DPP in primary care settings is lower than the original study. A meta-analysis of 36 pragmatic clinical trials of DPP in primary care settings showed a reduction in T2D incidence by 26%, less than half than the original study (58%), with a pooled mean weight loss 1.57 kg higher than standard care, demonstrating the large difficulties to reduce weight of participants at community levels. Total diet replacement (TDR) with low-energy liquid-diet or solid diet (825-853 kcal/day) is an effective strategy to reduce weight. The effectiveness of an intervention including initial rapid weight loss before starting the DPP is ignored in primary care levels in Venezuela. We aim: 1- To compare the weight loss achieved of two lifestyle intervention programs in a community health center of Venezuela: a) A hybrid lifestyle including rapid weight loss with total diet replacement (TDR), then medical nutrition therapy (MNT), and the DPP, VS b) only the DPP; 2- To evaluate the change of cardiometabolic risk factors between groups; 3- To evaluate the implementation process.

260,Idiopathic Reactive Hypoglycaemia and Treatment With Fructo-Oligosaccharide,0,"Idiopathic reactive hypoglycemia (IRH) describes a condition where recurrent episodes of symptomatic hypoglycemia occurs one to four hours after a meal, usually following meals rich in carbohydrates. Differential diagnoses to be excluded include those caused by isulinomas or bariatric surgery (dumping syndrome), or iatrogenic induced hypoglycaemia.

The prevalence of IRH is not fully known. A British trial among 1136 random chosen women aged 17-50, reported that 37.9% experienced symptomatic hypoglycemia four times every month (mean value). However, not all reported symptoms attributed to a low blood glucose (BG) correlates with measured low levels of BG and a ""true"" hypoglycaemic episode, i.e., as defined by American Diabetes Association (ADA) when plasma BG value is \< 3,9 mmol/l with or without accompanying symptoms. This was underscored in three studies from England, Canada and Denmark, in whom all reported hypoglycaemic symptoms, but in whom accompanying plasma glucose values \< 3,3 mmol/l during hypoglycaemic symptoms only occurred in 23, 47 and 0% of the study subjects, respectively. The majority of those with symptoms related to IRH hence are having these symptoms without being classified as hypoglycemic according to conventional interpretations. However, a new (2005) ADA definition; relative hypoglycemia, also comprise these symptomatic cases of hypoglycemia following a plasma glucose \> 3,9 mmol/l.

Hormonal and cerebral mechanisms tightly control the complex interplay of mechanisms involved in regulating BG concentration. Explanations for IRH are centralized around increased insulin secretion/sensitivity and/or down regulated transcription of glucagon receptor or reduced glucagons sensitivity- and secretion. Others assess an overabundance of adrenaline and cortisol, witch is excreted at the nadir of the BS curve (venous plasma glucose between 3.6 and 3.9). The latter event, during which typical symptoms is characterized of anxiety, fatigue, irritability, palpitations, nervousness, tachycardia, tremor and sweat.

Today, treatment is limited to dietary recommendations of eating frequent meals of moderate size, reasonably high in protein, and with a low glycaemic load. These advices keep cerebral glucose concentration stable and prohibit neuroglycopenic symptoms like hunger, dizziness, tingling, blurred vision, difficulty in thinking, and faintness. Pharmacologic attempts in treating IRH involves diazoxide, metformin, α-glucosidase inhibitor, glitazones and somatostatin, however, none of these medications are specifically indicated for the condition.

Fiber is a class of carbohydrate resistant to hydrolytic digestion in the upper bowel but fermented in the colon by bacterially produced enzymes. It makes the rate of ventricular emptying increase and prolongs the bowel transit time; thus having a minimal impact on BG values. Inulin and oligofructose are composed of polymers of oligofructose having characteristic features different from other fibers because of their physiological and biochemical attributes. Found in a variety of edible fruit and vegetables, their fermentation produces short-chain fatty acids that acidify the colonic content. This stimulates selectively the growth of beneficial and potentially health-promoting bifidobacteria and reduces potential harmful colon bacteria. Acting as prebiotica, oligofructose induces changes in the colonic epithelium and in miscellaneous colonic functions, inter alia, enhances calcium and magnesium absorption, modulates endocrine as well as immune functions and affects the metabolism of lipids positively. The latter, being at a systemic level, may contribute to modulating lipogenesis and reducing triglyceridemia by partially impairing hepatic cholesterol synthesis.

FOS has not yet been investigated thoroughly as a possible stabilizer of blood glucose. However, several non-oligofructose studies, using a high-fiber diet, indicates reduced pre-prandial BG values, less hypoglycemic cases, glukosuri, total cholesterol, triglycerides, VLDL cholesterol and area under the curve (AUC) in a 24 hours measurement (every 2 hour) of BG and insulin concentration.

Clinical evaluation of safety of inulin and oligofruktose as dietary fiber has reported 20 g/day of oligofructose to be well tolerated. The various GI side effects identified include abdominal pain and bloating, flatulence and osmotic diarrhea.

Despite the fact that fiber intake is proven inversely related to hypoglycemic events, possible benefits of daily FOS-supplementation have not yet been investigated systematically in persons suffering of IRH. Given the estimated high prevalence of IRH it is in our aim to:

264,Stretching With And Without Pressure Biofeeback In Patients With Postural Syndrome,0,"Postural syndrome describes a variety of conditions in which repetitive or continued bad posture over a long period of time causes pain and reduced function in the muscles and joints.

Improper posture can cause pain throughout the length of the spine from the neck to the pelvis. Modern sedentary style of living is one of the main reasons for postural abnormalities evident in modern society. The prolonged sitting hours required in most of the jobs, and educational setups can affect flexibility of soft tissues, especially two joint muscles. Bad posture while standing or walking, if left uncorrected, can worsen over time and lead to pain and dysfunction. Hamstring is a key component of flexibility in the human body and it is more prone to get tightened. Many reasons can lead to the development of hamstring tightness such as genetic predisposition, injury to muscle, and adaptive shortening due to some chronic condition. Short hamstring muscles, because of their attachments to the posterior leg and to the ischial tuberosity, may limit hip flexion ROM and induces posterior pelvic tilt and decreased lumbar lordosis, which can result in LBP The purpose of this study will be to find out the effects of stretching with and without pressure biofeedback unit (PBU) on hamstring muscle flexibility in patients with postural syndrome. The active knee extension (AKE) test will be used to determine the length of the hamstring muscles using a goniometer. A PBU will be used to maintain the anterior pelvic tilt position during active knee extension (AKE) test or stretching, by monitoring the pressure of airbag.

276,Sprifermin (AS902330) in Cartilage Injury Repair (CIR),1,"Several people all over the world suffer from cartilage injuries in the knee. Symptoms include pain, joint swelling, and loss of function. Without repair, cartilage injury may ultimately lead to osteoarthritis (OA). Natural healing is poor, and to date treatment is available only for deep cartilage defects involving also the underlying bone. A promising candidate for drug treatment of cartilage injury is sprifermin (AS902330), a recombinant form of the human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 18.

So far, the drug has been used in subjects with different stages of knee OA in two ongoing studies without emerging safety issues following single and multiple intra-articular injections of ascending doses. However, OA represents late-stage cartilage injury, where repair might be difficult due to diffuse damage, reduced responsiveness of the cartilage, and/or the involvement of other joint structures.

This clinical trial is meant to provide the proof of concept and to identify an efficacious dose of sprifermin (AS902330) for the treatment of adult subjects with acute cartilage injuries of the knee.

280,COPD Discharge Bundle Delivered Alone or Enhanced Through a Care Coordinator,0,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, chronic progressive lung disease that is characterized by shortness of breath, activity limitation, and a predisposition to flare-ups resulting in frequent emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations. COPD flare-ups increase risks of disease progression and mortality and account for the greatest proportion of preventable hospitalizations among major chronic diseases.

Evidence show that timely integrated disease management can prevent future COPD flare-ups and readmissions, but recent data indicate that appropriate follow-up after a COPD hospitalization is limited. To reduce this care gap, the investigators developed a discharge care bundle to help a patient that are being discharged from hospital or ED after COPD flare-up transition to community care.

The aim of this study is to assess how effective and cost-effective is such bundle delivered alone or supported by the dedicated care manager.

The purpose of this study was to compare effects of one month of treatment of CPAP and placebo on appearance of patient with OSA in a randomized and crossover study.

Consecutive sleepy patients with severe OSA were included. The patients underwent three polysomnograms (PSG): first one to confirm OSA and two additional ones using placebo (nasal dilator) and for CPAP titration before starting each treatment period. All patients were randomly included into two treatment groups: 1) placebo use and 2) CPAP use. After one month with the first treatment and 15 days of washout, patients were crossed-over for the second treatment. Photographs from the patients' faces were obtained in the three experimental moments. The photographs were presented in a random order by the Qualtrics Survey Software, and were evaluated online by 704 observers for quantifying healthy appearance (unhealthy to extremely healthy), attractive (unattractive to extremely attractive) and tired (not tired to extremely tired). Apparent age was also rated for each observer. Quantitative evaluations of the skin characteristics of the patients' faces were also carried out at each experimental moment, including the presence of acne, patches, porosity, wrinkles, texture, and skin tone uniformity, through the capture of images by VISIATM System equipment.

292,A Pilot Trial of Rituxan in Refractory Myasthenia Gravis,0,"Myasthenia gravis is a disease that happens because the immune system attacks the nervous system. The damage is caused by antibodies produced by B lymphocytes. These antibodies damage a special part of the muscle that helps transmit impulses from nerves to muscles to allow muscles to work properly. This damage results in symptoms of myasthenia gravis. Participants are being asked to participate in this research study because their myasthenia gravis has either failed to respond to treatments commonly used in the disease, or they have had bad side-effects from such treatments.

This is a research study of a drug called Rituximab. Rituximab, also called Rituxan, is a mouse antibody that has been changed to make it similar to a human antibody. Antibodies are proteins that can protect the body from foreign invaders, such as bacteria and viruses, by binding to substances called antigens. Rituxan works by binding to a protein, called the CD20 protein. Rituxan helps to destroy white blood cells that produce antibodies in the body, called B-lymphocytes. It is a treatment given through a vein in the participant's arm over a period of approximately 4-6 hours. It has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients with a form of cancer of the lymph glands called Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). Rituximab is not approved for their myasthenia gravis.

Treatment with Rituximab is being tried in this research study because Rituximab decreases B lymphocytes. There is preliminary evidence that Rituximab helps some patients with chronic and otherwise difficult to treat myasthenia gravis.",0,Refractory Myasthenia Gravis,drug: rituximab (rituxan),"To examine the effects of rituximab on disease activity in MG patients with refractory disease., Patients will be followed for one year","To determine the safety and tolerability of rituximab in MG patients with refractory disease., Patients will be followed for one year",University of Vermont,"Genentech, Inc.",ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1|PHASE2,9-19,OTHER,1,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,"State University of New York, Syracuse, New York, 13210, United States|University of Vermont Department of Neurology, Burlington, Vermont, 05405, United States",1461-2049

294,Physicians' Experiences With and Attitudes Toward Non-Medical Sex Selection Through Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis,0,"Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is an assisted reproductive technology (ART) by which embryos, created through in vitro fertilization (IVF), can be screened for genetic conditions or traits before they are implanted into a woman s uterus. Within the past few years, a controversial non-medical use of PGD has gained recognition as having possible significant ethical implications. Non-medical sex selection (NMSS) describes the use of PGD technology to choose the sex of a child for social, as opposed to medical, reasons. In the US and a select few other countries, it is legal to use NMSS for family balancing, or the intentional selection of an underrepresented sex to balance a family where the majority of the children are of one sex. Proponents of family balancing believe that NMSS is an expression of reproductive autonomy and is ethically acceptable on those grounds. Opponents are more likely to cite beneficence (toward the existing children and the potential future child) and justice (resource allocation and access, for example) as the basis for concerns around NMSS and family balancing specifically. In the US and other countries, healthcare providers (HCPs) are often the gatekeepers to this technology. There is little research exploring the experiences of HCPs with PGD and NMSS. The Moral Experience framework (Hunt and Carnevale, 2011) is useful for understanding the potential concerns of HCPs as well as their feelings and behaviors evoked by lived and hypothetical experiences around NMSS. Also of interest is how HCPs feel that decisions about NMSS are made and their preferences as to how they should be made. Finally, there is concern that NMSS may be the first in a line of non-medical uses for PGD and that a slippery slope toward what some describe as designer babies will follow. We are interested in eliciting the traits that HCPs believe are hypothetically appropriate or inappropriate for PGD and how they make the distinction. Interviews with HCPs (OBGYNs and reproductive endocrinologists) on these topics will be transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis in order to identify common themes. An understanding of the experiences and attitudes of this stakeholder population can help clarify current issues at individual, societal, and global levels and future directions for research and policy....",0,Genetics|Attitudes,unknown,"Experiences, This study seeks to describe the experiences of healthcare providers around pre- implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for non-medical sex selection (NMSS), with a particular focus on potential ethical concerns, their role in the decision-making process, and their views on future appropriate and inappropriate non-medical uses of PGD., Enrollment",none,National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI),none,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NO PHASE,9-19,GOVERNMENT,0,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,"National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States",123-244

Not only gastric emptying importance to anesthetists is related to aspiration but also it is important to determine the systemic availability of substances given through the mouth. Delayed gastric emptying represents a major danger as it causes nausea and vomiting and prevents a return to oral feeding. Lastly it may cause morbidity and mortality.

Both humoral and neural influences have their impact on emptying. Volume and composition of gastric food act as major determinants for the rate of gastric emptying. The effect of body weight on gastric emptying are inconsistent.

ASA fasting guidelines application represents the primary method to avoid aspiration as it ensures that stomach is empty before induction of anesthesia.

343,Effectiveness and Safety of Salba on Weight Loss in Overweight Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes,0,"Canadian statistics indicate that the incidence of obesity is increasing and that the occurrence of diabetes in obese individuals is 5-fold greater than those with a healthy weight, making weight control in this population particularly relevant. Preliminary clinical data has shown that the whole grain, Salba, may improve type 2 diabetes control, reduce after-meal blood glucose, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and suppress appetite. Its use may therefore have potential implications in long-term weight management, while improving diabetes.

The objective of this research (weight loss) is to evaluate whether adding Salba to an energy reduced diet for six months will result in greater weight loss compared to control in overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. The study recruited 77 overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. They were instructed to follow a calorie restricted diet and their regular diabetes therapy together with regular exercise. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 30 g Salba/1000 kcal of daily energy requirements, or an oat bran control supplement matched for energy. The effect of the supplements on weight-loss (including waist circumference, % body fat) and glucose control (A1c, fasting glucose levels) will be assessed. In addition, related outcomes such as low-grade body inflammation, hunger-regulating hormones (ghrelin, adiponectin), safety measures (urea, creatinine, ALT and prothrombin time) and satiety scores were evaluated.

Modest weight loss has been associated with improved glucose control in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Addition of Salba to an energy reduced diet may facilitate greater weight loss and improve glycemic control and CVD risk factors compared to such a diet alone. Salba may also promote maintenance of weight loss and therefore help prevent weight gain by providing feelings of fullness that reduce appetite. In light of the high incidence of obesity in individuals with diabetes, Salba grain may be a useful addition to the diet.",0,Diabetes Mellitus|Overweight|Obesity,dietary_supplement: salba (salvia hispanica l.)|dietary_supplement: oat-based control,"Weight, 24 week timeframe for Weightloss phase, 24 weeks","Body composition, 24 week timeframe for Weightloss phase, 24 weeks|Blood sugar control, (HbA1c and Fasting glucose) 24 week timeframe for Weightloss phase, 24 weeks|Low grade body inflammation, hs-CRP levels, 24 weeks|serum ALT, Safety Measures, 24 weeks|Prothrombin time, Safety Measures, 24 weeks|serum creatinine, Safety Measures, 24 weeks|Blood urea, Safety Measures, 24 weeks|Satiety hormones, ghrelin, adiponectin, 24 weeks|Fatty Acids (% composition), ALA (18:3 n-3), LA (18:2 n-6); Compliance measure, 24 weeks",Unity Health Toronto,Canadian Diabetes Association,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,60-79,OTHER,1,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT","Risk Factor Modification Centre, St. Michael's, Toronto, Ontario, M5B1W8, Canada",2050-38562

Treatment failure is defined by not achieving remission after treatment adaptation following a relapse according to protocol (CDAI\<150 or, in case of relapse defined by the occurence of a new fistula, the absence of fistula closure). The occurence of an intra-abdominal or peri-anal abcess and the occurence of an intestinal obstruction due to Crohn's lesions and requiring a surgical resection or an endoscopic dilatation are also directly considered as treatment failure and will not be managed by treatment adaptation according to protocol.

352,PBMT for the Prevention of CIPN,0,"ne of the most common cancers in women worldwide is breast cancer. A common used therapy in early-stage and metastatic breast cancer involves chemotherapy. Taxanes, microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs), are one of the most used chemotherapeutic agents in breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, this treatment comes with many unfortunate side effects. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is one of these common side effects. This condition involves paresthesia, numbness and/or burning pain in distal limbs. Eventually, loss of temperature sensation, loss of tendon reflexes and pain sensation can occur. Yet, no therapies have been developed to treat CIPN. At the moment, only symptom management is possible. Not only will this condition affect the patients' daily activities, but a chemotherapy dose reduction could also be necessary, influencing the outcome and overall survival rate of the patient.

A new and emerging treatment for CIPN is photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) or low-level laser therapy. During PBMT, visible and/or (near)-infrared laser light is used at the affected area to improve tissue repair and thereby promote functional recovery of peripheral nerves. Studies have shown positive results for patients with diabetic neuropathy. However, no studies have been undertaken specifically for taxane-induced neuropathy (TIN).

We hypothesize that PBMT is an effective treatment strategy to prevent sensory symptoms associated with TIN.

369,Non- Inferiority Fractional-doses Trial for Yellow Fever Vaccine,0,"In the recent past there has been a number of large urban Yellow Fever outbreaks in sub-Saharan Africa, tropical South Americas, The demand for Yellow Fever vaccines in response to the large urban outbreaks occurring concurrently and the risk of further spread through Africa and to Asia was larger than the available global supply. In this situation, the World Health Organisation (WHO) developed recommendations for the use of fractional doses of Yellow Fever vaccine as a dose-sparing strategy. These recommendations were based on data from a limited number of clinical trials, none of which had been conducted in Africa. This was due to the uncertainties on the minimum dose requirement.

Our study complements a study which is comparing full standard dose to 1/5th of standard dose of all four WHO-prequalified YF vaccines in adults (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT02991495), and is currently ongoing at KEMRI CGMRC and Epicentre, Mbarara which is designed to answer questions on the use of current stock of YF vaccines with a potency as close as possible to each manufacturers' minimum release. Data from this trial will inform a WHO recommendation on using 1/5th of the current standard dose of vaccine for outbreak control. However, since many vials will contain excess YF vaccine such that 1/5th of a vial is likely to be substantially above the current minimum potency requirements, these data may not be scientifically explanatory regarding the minimum dose required for preventive use.

The new complementary study, aims to determine the lowest YF vaccine dose that is non-inferior to the current standard full dose among populations in sub-Saharan Africa. The study will be conducted in Kenya (KEMRI Center for Geographical Medicine Research-Coast (CGMR-C), Kilifi) and Uganda (Epicentre, Mbarara) with trial participants recruited at both sites, using vaccine from one WHO-prequalified manufacturer (Institut Pasteur de Dakar, Senegal (IPD)).",0,Yellow Fever,"biological: yellow fever vaccine, institut pasteur","The proportion of vaccinees that seroconverts as measured by Plaque Reduction Neutralisation Test (PRNT-50), PRNT-50 will be used to quantify functional antibodies by neutralisation of the virus, 28 days post vaccination","Duration of immunity as measured by PRNT, To describe the longevity of functional antibodies post-vaccination with the different doses as measured by PRNT, 10 days, 28 days, 1 year and 2 years (adults)|Change in the geometric mean fold of the antibody titre as measured by PRNT, To describe change in the geometric mean antibodies between baseline and 28 days after vaccination., Baseline and 28 days after vaccination|Other flavivirus antibodies interference as tested by neutralisation tests, To measure the impact of antibodies to other flaviviruses (including dengue, West Nile and zika viruses) on the baseline sample on YF vaccine immunogenicity 28 days after vaccination by pairwise comparison., Baseline and 28 days after vaccination|Post-vaccination viremia as measured by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), To assess post-vaccination control of viremia by different vaccine doses by sparse sampling, baseline, and on days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10 after vaccination|Changes in cellular immunology, To determine the change in T and B cell immune responses between baseline and days post-vaccination, baseline and days 10 and 28 post-vaccination.|Changes in biomarkers, To determine the change in serum biomarkers levels (including, TNF, INF-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-8/CXCL-8, MCP-1/CCL-2, MIG/CXCL-9 and IP-10/CXCL-10) between baseline and post-vaccination by pairwise comparison., Baseline, and on days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,10 and 28 after vaccination|Safety of different doses as described by the occurrence of adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events., To assess the occurrence of adverse events (AE) over 28 days after vaccination and serious adverse events throughout the duration of the study., 28 days after vaccination and an average of 1 year for the adult study and two years for the children study. .",University of Oxford,"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Collaborative Research Program|Institut Pasteur|MRC/UVRI and LSHTM Uganda Research Unit|Epicentre, Paris, France.",ALL,"CHILD, ADULT",PHASE4,491-188814085,OTHER,1,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION","KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Coast, 254, Kenya|Epicentre, Mbarara., Mbarara, Uganda",1098-1460

378,"Growth, Health and Development in Children Born Extremely Preterm",0,"Background: In a national Norwegian cohort of children born before 28 weeks gestation or with a birth weight less than 1000 g born in 1999 and 2000, 372 survived. Compared with earlier studies survival increased for the most immature infants, but at the cost of more early complications and a high rate of impairments, while the less immature children had fewer early complications and less impairments detectable within 5 years. These changes show the importance of monitoring outcome as treatment modalities change. Large brain haemorrhages were highly predictive of severe disabilities, but we have not found good predictive factors for milder impairments such as cognitive, behavioural and motor difficulties. However, at 5 years later function may be difficult to predict, and the children's potentials are better understood after completing several years in school. Objectives: The children will be re-examined at age 11 in order to assess their physical and mental health, and cognitive, motor and social function, and to determine if early life events and development at 2 and 5 years are predictive of long term health and functioning. MRI-studies, including functional MRI will be performed to examine if different outcomes related to brain function can be explained by differences in brain development. Methods: For all, data will be collected from the compulsory national test in 5th grade and questionnaires to the child, parents and teacher. For children in Western Norway (n=87) extensive examinations of lung and brain function, including clinical diagnostic tests and MRI, will be added.

Early enteral nutrition is a major component of the recently introduced post operative rehabilitative regimens.

Early feeding has been shown to reduce the risk of any specific infection, mean length of hospital stay, anastomotic dehiscence, wound infection, pneumonia, intra abdominal abscesses. It leads to lower weight loss and early positive nitrogen balance. Hence, overall early enteral nutrition leads to reduced post operative morbidity and better patient outcome.

423,Air Barrier System for the Prevention of Surgical Site Infection,0,"Airborne particles are present in all indoor environments including the operating room. Most of these particles come from the surgical staff moving around in the room, positioning of the patient during surgery, and the movement of surgical equipment and supplies. While the amount of particulate in an operating room is much, much less than is found in a typical home or public space, some particulate is usually present no matter how the room and air are cleaned and filtered. Typically these few particulate cause no problems, but the goal is always to have the cleanest air possible during surgery. The Air Barrier System (ABS) consists of a reusable blower and a sterile nozzle. The blower feeds filtered air into the sterile disposable nozzle, which disperses a constant stream of gentle, high purity air over the surgical incision. This stream of air forms a shield over the surgical area to prevent airborne particulate from settling into the open wound. This is particularly critical for long-duration surgeries, such as procedures that involve the implantation of a prosthesis. The main objective of this research study is to determine whether the ABS can reduce the potential for surgical site infection during total hip replacement, spinal fusion, or lower extremity bypass grafting procedures. These procedures were chosen because each is a long-duration procedure which involves implantation of prosthesis.",1,Surgical Site Infection,device: air barrier system,"Incidence of Implant Infection (Number of Occurrences in Each Arm)., Fewer patients in the Air Barrier System group will have implant infection compared to the Control group.

Its most frequently identified indications are the fight against acute or chronic pains, the reduction of anxiety, depression and stress, as well as memory disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

The main modes of action of music therapy involve sensory, cognitive, psychological and behavioral processes that are also found in pruritus.

Pruritus is defined as ""an uncomfortable sensation causing the need to scratch. It has similarities with pain but also differences: relief by heat / cold, scratching / withdrawal behavior, localization on the skin, semi-mucous / ubiquitous ... etc.

The pathophysiology also has similarities, pruritus is born at the dermal-epidermal junction at the level of specific cutaneous receptors then follows the classical pathways through a 1st neuron, then the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and a second neuron. At the cerebral level, there is no single center of pruritus but several motor and sensory areas involved.

442,Infrared Imaging in Septic Illness,0,"The application of infrared thermal imaging in the diagnosis and prognostication of septic illness in adults.

During times of severe infection (sepsis), the small blood vessels supplying oxygen and nutrients to the skin and other organs (called the microcirculation), become abnormal and do not function as they normally would in health. Monitoring these small blood vessels is difficult to do clinically and the investigators want to investigate a new way of doing this.

The aim of this study is to validate a novel method of assessing the function of the microcirculation in healthy volunteers and patients with sepsis, by measuring the skin temperature profile of the leg and face with a thermal imaging camera. Thermal imaging cameras measure the heat given off by all objects and represents this as a picture, with colour used to represent the different temperatures.

Patients will be recruited from the Emergency Department and Intensive Care Units at University Hospitals of Leicester in to one of two groups based on their illness severity; uncomplicated sepsis and severe sepsis. Healthy volunteers will be recruited in to a third group. Recruitment will take place over a 6-month period with follow-up lasting for 12-months following recruitment. 105 participants will be recruited in total.

Temperature patterns seen on the face and leg will be investigated between the different groups. Changes in these temperature patterns as patients recover from sepsis (or indeed become worse), will also be investigated.

473,Transfusional Iron Overload Among Leukemia Survivors,0,"Red cell transfusions are an important part of supportive cancer therapy. The iron in the transfused blood may build up in the body since the human body has no way to get rid of extra iron. Iron tends to build up in the liver and the heart muscle. It is unknown if iron build-up is present many years after completing cancer therapy. It is also not known if extra iron causes harm to internal organs. Researchers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) want to understand if iron build-up (called ""iron overload"") exists in survivors of leukemia. They also want to know if iron overload can cause injury to your organs if it is present.

Liver iron accumulation has been documented in childhood cancer survivors, however, it is not known if iron associated organ toxicity is contributing to the long-term morbidity that has been well documented among these survivors. This study will investigate the prevalence of iron overload and the association of tissue iron burden with markers of organ dysfunction in leukemia survivors. This study will determine the prevalence of iron overload among long-term leukemia survivors that underwent blood transfusion. This study will use blood and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) testing to determine iron overload of specified organs. Understanding the prevalence of iron overload could impact surveillance practices in leukemia survivors.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

* To determine the prevalence of iron overload in the liver \[liver iron concentration (LIC) \>3mg/g using R2\* MRI measurements\] and in the heart (T2\* \<20 ms) among long-term leukemia survivors transfused with ≥50ml/kg of packed red blood cells.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

* To examine the relationship between hepatic, cardiac, and endocrine dysfunction and transfusionally acquired iron overload as defined by R2\* and T2\* MRI among survivors of pediatric leukemias.
* To investigate the association between serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, non-transferrin-bound iron, and hepcidin measurements with R2\* and T2\* MRI-defined iron overload.",0,Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia|Acute Myeloid Leukemia,unknown,"Proportion of iron overload, Iron overload will be measured by R2\*MRI in the liver and T2\* in the heart and is defined as R2\*MRI value \> 3 mg/g and/or T2\* MRI \<20ms., On day of enrollment","Relationship between hepatic, cardiac, and endocrine dysfunction and transfusionally-acquired iron overload, Fisher's Exact test will be performed to examine the relationship of organ dysfunction and iron overload.

490,A Pilot Study of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Chemotherapy and Blood Levels of Organochlorines,0,"Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is the third most rapidly increasing cancer in the United States. HIV-related NHL is responsible for some of the increase since the early 1980s. However, it cannot explain the steady increase in the incidence rates in earlier years, nor the entire increase shown recently. A possible role of environmental exposures is receiving attention. One possibility is that exposure to organochlorines (OCs) may be related to the occurrence of NHL. NCI is currently designing a large population-based case-control study to investigate this hypothesis further by analyzing OC levels in blood collected at the time of interview from cases of NHL and their matched controls. At the time of these interviews, cases in the main case-control study would most likely have already received chemotherapy. If chemotherapy changes the blood levels of OCs, this may lead to misclassification of exposure among cases and eventually to biased risk estimates. The purpose of this pilot study is to estimate the bias due to measuring the serum levels of OCs in cases during or after chemotherapy. Twenty newly diagnosed patients will be recruited for the study. From each patient, four consecutive blood samples, one prior to, two during, and one after chemotherapy, will be collected. Forty pairs of pre-existing cryopreserved serum samples (pre- and post-treatment) taken from the NHL patients who participated in an earlier NCI clinical study will also be included in this study. Samples will be assayed for OC levels.

495,The Effects of Concentration/Meditation on the Innate Immune Response During Human Endotoxemia,0,"The innate immune response is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Ideally, the inflammatory response is tightly regulated leading to both adequate protection to invading pathogens as well as limitation of an exuberant or unwanted immune response such as seen in sepsis or auto-immune diseases. It has become increasingly clear that the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the innate immune response are intimately linked. Activation of the sympathetic division of ANS dampens inflammation via β2-adrenoceptors. On the other hand, in some cases, sympathetic drive can also stimulate the inflammatory response via α2-adrenoceptors. The parasympathetic branch of the ANS modulates the inflammatory response as well, since it was discovered that electrical stimulation of the efferent vagus nerve in rats greatly inhibits the innate immune response. Generally, the ANS is regarded as pure autonomic which can not be influenced by behavior. However, trough special concentration/mediation techniques mastered by certain individuals, it might be possible to modulate ANS activity. In addition, recent unpublished findings indicate that these concentration/meditation techniques can also influence the inflammatory response ex vivo.

In this study the investigators wish to investigate the effect of concentration/meditation on the innate immune response in vivo. In addition the investigators wish to elucidate the mechanism via which this effect is mediated. The investigators aim to use the so called human endotoxemia model. This model permits elucidation of key players in the immune response to a gram negative stimulus in vivo, therefore serving as a useful tool to investigate potential novel therapeutic strategies in a standardized setting.

Objectives:

Primary objective: The primary objective of the study is to determine the effect of concentration/meditation on the innate immune response induced by a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge.

496,"Adolescent Dysmenorrhea : Prevalence, Severity, Experience and Management in the Use of Medication in High School Girls in Ille-et-Vilaine",0,"Dysmenorrhea or painful menstruation is a common symptom of menses. Dysmenorrhea is defined as a painful, cramping sensation in the lower abdomen or back associated with menstrual periods and is classified into primary and secondary types. Primary dysmenorrhea is painful menstrual periods not due to other diseases, and often occurs soon after menarche. Secondary dysmenorrhea is due to an underlying pelvic abnormality, such as endometriosis.

Dysmenorrhea is the most common gynecological complaint. In many studies, the prevalence of primary dysmenorrhea varies between 34 % in 2010 in Egypt, 86.6% in 2002 in Switzerland, and 21% in 1999 in France.

Nowadays, physiopathology is better understood, which suggests that the investigators have treatments Although dysmenorrhea is a common concern, many women never seek medical advice, even though treatments are easily available and simple.

In fact, despite the high prevalence, dysmenorrhea is undertreated and even disregarded by health professionals, and the girls themselves, who may accept it as a normal part of the menstrual cycle.

The pain occurs just before and/or during menstruation ; it can be mild to severe and is frequently associated with many other symptoms, like nausea, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, tiredness and has many consequences in wellbeing and school. Dysmenorrhea is known to be the first cause of absenteism from school, and appears to have many consequences and a real impact on women's daily activities, which is why it's a public health problem.

Because of the lack of recent studies in France, the aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of adolescent dysmenorrhea. The investigators also assessed its severity, how adolescent girls experienced their menses, and how they manage their pain (seeking medical consultation, use of medication).

The investigators used a self-assessment questionnaire in a cohort of high school girls, aged 15 to 19 years old, during April and May of 2019, in 8 private and public high schools in Ille-et-Vilaine.",0,Adolescent Dysmenorrhea,other: anonymous survey,"Prevalence of dysmenorrhea, "" During last past year, have you ever experienced pain in your lower abdomen or back associated with menstrual periods ?
