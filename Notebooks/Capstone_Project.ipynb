The medical aim is to study mediating mechanisms of the physiological, biochemical and molecular effects of exercise training on the clinical outcomes. The aim of the health-economic evaluation is to assess the changes in the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) and health care related costs for estimating the cost-effectiveness of HIT-based exercise rehabilitation.
