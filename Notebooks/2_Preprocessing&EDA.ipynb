    "- The previous notebook consists of the raw dataset and the steps involved in cleaning. We also performed preliminary EDA and highlighted the distribution of important columns and analyzed what potential features we should include in the model.\n",
    "- In this notebook, we will complete a second round of more in-depth cleaning and exploratory data analysis. Our goal is to create a baseline model for statistical analysis, prepare for feature engineering and modelling."
