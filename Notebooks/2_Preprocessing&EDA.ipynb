    "- The previous notebook consists of the raw dataset and the steps involved in cleaning. We also performed preliminary EDA which highlighted the distribution of important columns and analyzed what potential features we should include in the model.\n",
    "- In this notebook, we will complete a second round of more in-depth cleaning and exploratory data analysis. Our goal is to make sure the data is prepared for creating a baseline model.\n",
    "- The data type of each column will be organized according to their relevant information. This makes it easier to create dummy variables for modelling."
