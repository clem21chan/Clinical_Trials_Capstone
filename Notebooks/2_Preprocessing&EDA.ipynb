    "- In this notebook, we will complete a second round of more in-depth cleaning and exploratory data analysis. Our goal is to create a baseline model for statistical analysis, prepare for feature engineering and modelling."

    "Interesting to note that studies that last 123-244 days have the least amount of terminated trials and 672-861 days have the most terminated trials. There doesn't seem to be a pattern here, but we should view the percentage of terminated trials in each duration category. We can do this by using the .mean() function instead of .sum() because `Study Status` is a binary column."
